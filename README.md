# Exposure Triangle Recognition

As the digital world continues to expand, the size and amount of data available, including images, are experiencing unprecedented levels of growth as well. Downloading such images from the internet can result in the loss of certain information that may be useful for gathering insights. Exif data is often purposefully omitted for privacy concerns. In this work, we introduce the application of various machine learning models alongside deep neural networks for the purposes of exposure triangle recognition. We attempt to retrieve some of this nonsensitive Exif data, specifically those relating to the exposure triangle - Shutter Speed, Aperture and ISO. This study incorporates models including Decision Trees, RandomForest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost. Additional metrics are introduced to account for dependencies observed in specific settings. These metrics include image mean, laplacian variance value, directional blur, and noise level. We also develop Neural Network Models based on both Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. Certain insights are derived with varying degrees of efficacy.
